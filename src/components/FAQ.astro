  {
    q: "Does it work offline?",
    a: "Yes! AuraFolio runs completely offline after installation. No internet connection required for viewing your PDF sheet music.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it free to use?",
    a: "Yes, AuraFolio is completely free. No subscriptions, no ads, no tracking.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which file formats are supported?",
    a: "Currently, AuraFolio only supports PDF files. In the meantime, there are numerous PDF converters available online.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I navigate through pages?",
    a: "Use keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys), touch and drag on the sheet, or tap the sides of the screen for smooth, lag-free page turning.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why did you make AuraFolio?",
    a: "I wanted a minimal and efficient way to manage and view my sheet music, and there wasn't a quality option I liked. It's free for everyone since it was a hobby project that cost me nothing to create or host.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is there a warning popup for installation?",
    a: "The warning popup hasn't been removed because obtaining software certificates is expensive, especially for a project with no budget!",
