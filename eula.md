Effective date: 2025-08-24

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("User") and the developer or copyright holder of the software application known as "AuraFolio" (the "Software") (the "Licensor," "we," "us," or "our").

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not download, install, or use the Software.

## 1. License Grant
Subject to this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Software on devices you own or control for personal, non-commercial purposes.

## 2. Restrictions
You shall not:
- Copy, modify, translate, or create derivative works of the Software;
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except where permitted by applicable law;
- Rent, lease, sell, sublicense, distribute, or make the Software available to any third party;
- Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices or labels on the Software.

## 3. Ownership
The Software is licensed, not sold. All rights, title, and interest in and to the Software and its intellectual property are owned by the Licensor or its contributors. No rights are granted by implication or otherwise except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

## 4. Updates and Changes
We may provide updates, upgrades, or changes to the Software, which may modify or remove features. We are not obligated to provide maintenance or support unless we choose to do so. Any updates are governed by this Agreement unless a different license accompanies them.

## 5. Acceptable Use
You agree not to use the Software for any unlawful purpose or in high‑risk environments (including medical, life-support, nuclear, aviation, or safety-critical systems) where failure could result in injury, death, or severe property/environmental damage.

## 6. Privacy
The Software is an offline desktop application and does not intentionally collect, transmit, share, or sell personal data. If future versions introduce network features, a revised privacy notice will accompany those changes.

## 7. Third‑Party Components
The Software may include third‑party components subject to their own licenses. If applicable, such licenses and notices will be provided in a THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES file or within the Software.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED, THE LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT (IF ANY) YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, WHICH MAY BE ZERO FOR FREE SOFTWARE.

## 10. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold the Licensor harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your breach of this Agreement or misuse of the Software.

## 11. Termination
This Agreement is effective until terminated. It will terminate automatically if you breach any term. Upon termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies of the Software. Sections intended to survive (including 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13) shall survive termination.

## 12. Export and Compliance
You agree to comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and regulations and represent that you are not prohibited from receiving the Software.

## 13. Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by applicable United States law (primarily federal law). If you use the Software outside the U.S., you are responsible for complying with any mandatory local laws; your non‑waivable consumer rights are not limited by this Agreement.

## 14. Changes to this Agreement
We may update this Agreement from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective date" above. Continued use of the Software after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## 15. Entire Agreement
