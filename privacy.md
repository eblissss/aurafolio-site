# Privacy Policy

Last updated: August 22, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how AuraFolio handles information. AuraFolio is an offline desktop application. It does not collect, transmit, share, or sell any personal data.

## Scope

- This policy applies to the AuraFolio desktop application and any in‑app features.
- It does not cover third‑party websites that may be linked from documentation or release notes.

## Key points

- No data collection: The application does not collect, process, or transmit personal data or usage data.
- No accounts: The application does not use accounts, logins, or authentication.
- No telemetry or analytics: The application does not include telemetry, analytics, crash reporting, or error reporting services.
- No cookies or identifiers: The application does not use cookies, device identifiers, or similar tracking technologies.
- No third‑party SDKs: The application does not embed third‑party SDKs that collect data.
- No network activity: The application does not initiate any network requests.

## Local device access

- Local files: The application may read or write files locally on the device solely to provide core functionality (for example, saving application data or user preferences).
- Local storage: Any settings or configuration remain on the device and are not transmitted.

## Website and downloads

- If downloading from a hosting platform (e.g., a code hosting or file distribution site), that platform may generate routine server logs (such as IP address and user agent) under its own privacy policy. AuraFolio does not control those logs.
- If contacting us via external channels (e.g., issue tracker or email), any information voluntarily provided there is handled within those platforms and is not collected by the application.

## Children’s privacy

- The application does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children. Because the app does not collect data, parental consent is not applicable.

## Data sharing and sale

- No sharing: The application does not share any personal data with third parties.
- No sale: The application does not sell personal data.

## Data security

- Because the application does not collect or transmit data, there is no personal data stored on our servers. Users are responsible for securing any files saved locally on their own devices.

## Changes to this policy

- If the application’s functionality changes in a way that affects privacy (for example, adding optional online features), this policy will be updated with a new effective date and clear description of changes.
